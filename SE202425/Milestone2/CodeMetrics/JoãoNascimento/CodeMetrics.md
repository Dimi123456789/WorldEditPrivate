Metrics set used:


CCC (Classic Cyclomatic Complexity): Measures the cyclomatic complexity of a class (loops and conditions).
High CCC values may lead to a class with very long methods with many conditions and loops, leading to a possible God Class or very long methods code smell.

CLOC (Comment Lines of Code): Measures the comment lines in font code.
High CLOC may lead to a Commented Code, or Excessive Comments, while Low CLOC may lead to a Lack of Documentaion code smell.

CMI (Complexity Measure Index): a combined metric of ciclomatic complexity, cohesion, coupling, etc. giving a global complexity index.
High CMI indicates a highly complex class, meaning high coupling, many methods, low cohesion and others, giving an idea of Spaghetti Code or a God class code smell.
