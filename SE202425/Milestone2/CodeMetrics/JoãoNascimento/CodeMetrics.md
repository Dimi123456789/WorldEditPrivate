Metrics set used: Lines of Code Metrics

NCSS (Non-Comment Source Statements): Measures the number of lines of actual code in a class or method excluding comments.
High NCSS indicates a large class or method, leading to Long Class or Long Method code smells, suggesting bloated functionality, and Low NCSS could indicate overly simple classes, possibly a sign of Speculative Generality (i.e., unnecessary placeholders for future functionality).

NOA (Number of Attributes): Counts the total number of attributes (fields) in classes.
High NOA could indicate a class storing too much state information, possibly leading to god classes or feature envy codesmells, while LOW NOA indicates a class not managing much data, which may align with a utility class.

NOAM (Number of Acessible Methods): Counts the number of public and protected methods in a class.
High NOAM classes with many public/protected methods can be too exposed, increasing their attack surface and suggesting a Divergent Class, Feature Envy or inappropriate intimacy code smell, while low NOAM classes indicate minimal public interface, appropriate for internal helper classes.

NOOM (Number of Overridden Methods): Counts how many override methods a class has.
High NOOM could point to refused bequest or god class code smell, while low NOOM indicates minimap specialization or inheritance. Also if the inheritance is unnecessary could lead to speculative generalty code smell.

NOO (Number of Operations): Measures the total number of operations (methods) in a class.
High NOO suggests a class doing too much, indicating a divergent or god class. Low NOO could mean the class has limited behavior, also could lead to a shotgun surgery codesmell, possibly serving as a placeholder or simple ultility.
